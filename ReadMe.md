## Cleaned up Playground (and dump) of stuff I forked for the Flipper Zero.
I've been working on cleaning up more of the project for myself and the scripts I plan to use. Please refer to the original repository for additional information.


I have removed non-US-based stores from the SubGHz group, such as 17 Sortir, as well as files not relevant to the Southeast US. Additionally, I've removed out-of-band files that could potentially damage the transmitter.
